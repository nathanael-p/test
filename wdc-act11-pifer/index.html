                <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                <p>One of my hobbies is playing video games. The first game I played was Lego Star Wars the Complete Saga on PS2. I since started playing more PC games. My favorite game is Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). I also play StarCraft 2 and Rainbow Six Siege.  I am also into competitive gaming. I watch a lot of different games. My favorite team is Team Liquid. Another hobby is showing cows. I started showing cows when I was 10. I have shown cows every year since. I have gotten Best Breed and Owned with my cow Tic Tac at our county fair. I also got second in my class at the state show and best breed and owned in my class. I got first in my class at the Junior All American Dairy Show with my cow Boo. I also showed chickens and dairy feeders at our country fair. </p>

                <h3>How I Became Interested In Creating Web Projects</h3>
                <p>I first got introduced to web design when I saw my friend coding on codecademy. I started to try it and was having fun. I took Web Design in High School and was really good at it. I also didn't want to farm so I was trying to find something I enjoyed doing. </p>
